Here we've added Chlorophyll a from MODIS/Aqua from the daytime overpass, which can be used as a proxy for the amount of organic material in the surface waters. Elevated chlorophyll concentrations (> 1 mg m<sup>−3</sup>) are shown in yellows to reds and occur directly adjacent to the milky sea. This may indicate regions of algal stress where bacteria would proliferate.

(Worldview currently does not have a Suomi NPP/VIIRS Chlorophyll a layer for this time period.)
